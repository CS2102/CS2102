1.  We provide the IReportSet interface. Users may implement this interface and still maintain
	the default functions needed by the weather monitor. They are able to change the type
	of the data held in the ArrayList.
	
	To create a weatherGlob data structure implementation for the reports, we simply call the
	WeatherMonitor constructor with a different initial IReportSet implementation.


2.  All instance variables are set to private access and there are no external methods that
    modify their values. All computations are done internally in the classes that hold the
    relevant data.
  
    
3.  We are fairly satisfied with the current structure of the code, but there are some methods,
    such as the averaging methods, which we feel could be generalized. However, at the moment,
    we do not know how to do so.
